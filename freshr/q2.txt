What do you think happens after a user clicks on a "Next" button in Freshr?

Ensure the state : did the user click the link? Yes? Store something in DB to mark this article as read.
Look for unread articles he could like into the almighty news bucket.
Give it to him.

In case of no new article available, answer him kindly that there is nothing left -> Here, Freshr in kinda bad. You answer "Did not understood".
Your handling of recurring unread news is perfectible: just spam Next and you'll have the same 4-5 articles looping. 
This could be taken in account here and say "Hey, I already told you this a few messages before, take a look 7 messages before."
